Scalar multiplication is an operation that scales a vector by a scalar (a real number), changing the magnitude of the vector without changing its direction. 
To perform scalar multiplication, we simply multiply each component of the vector by the scalar.

In two-dimensional space, scalar multiplication can be visualized as stretching or shrinking a vector without changing its direction.
For example, consider the vector v = (2,3) and the scalar c = 2.
To scale the vector by the scalar, we multiply each component of the vector by the scalar:

c * v = 2 * (2,3) = (4,6)

The resulting vector has the same direction as the original vector, but its magnitude has been doubled.

In three-dimensional space, scalar multiplication works in the same way as in two-dimensional space.

For example, consider the vector v = (1,2,3) and the scalar c = -3.
To scale the vector by the scalar, we multiply each component of the vector by the scalar:

c * v = -3 * (1,2,3) = (-3,-6,-9)

The resulting vector has the same direction as the original vector, but its magnitude has been multiplied by -3, 
which means that it has been reversed and stretched by a factor of 3.

Scalar multiplication satisfies several properties, including distributivity and associativity. 

For example:
c * (v1 + v2) = c * v1 + c * v2
(c1 * c2) * v = c1 * (c2 * v)

Scalar multiplication is an important operation in mathematics and physics, as it allows us to change the magnitude of a vector without changing its direction.
In physics, scalar multiplication is used to calculate the work done by a force,
which is the force applied to an object multiplied by the displacement of the object in the direction of the force.

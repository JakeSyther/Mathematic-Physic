There are several different operations that can be performed on vectors in mathematics and physics. Some of the most common vector operations include:

* Vector addition: Adding two or more vectors together to get a new vector that represents their combined effect.

* Scalar multiplication: Multiplying a vector by a scalar (a real number) to change its magnitude.

* Dot product: A scalar product of two vectors that produces a scalar value, used to calculate the angle between the two vectors.

* Cross product: A vector product of two vectors that produces a new vector perpendicular to both input vectors, used to calculate the area of a parallelogram.

* Projection: Finding the component of one vector that lies in the direction of another vector.

* Reflection: Finding the mirror image of a vector with respect to a given line or plane.

* Rotation: Rotating a vector around a fixed axis by a certain angle.

* Magnitude: Finding the length or magnitude of a vector.

* Normalization: Converting a vector into a unit vector (a vector with a magnitude of 1).

These are just a few of the most common vector operations, but there are many more that can be performed on vectors depending on the specific context and application.

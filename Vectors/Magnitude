Magnitude is a term used to describe the size or quantity of a physical quantity or measurement.
In mathematics and physics, magnitude typically refers to the absolute value, or size, of a scalar or vector quantity.

In the case of a scalar quantity, such as temperature, magnitude refers to the absolute value of the quantity without regard to its sign. 
For example, the magnitude of -5 degrees Celsius is 5 degrees Celsius, and the magnitude of 10 meters is 10 meters.

In the case of a vector quantity, such as velocity or force, magnitude refers to the length or size of the vector. 
This can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the magnitude of a vector in two or three dimensions is equal
to the square root of the sum of the squares of its components.

For example, the magnitude of a vector v = (3,4) is âˆš(3^2 + 4^2) = 5.

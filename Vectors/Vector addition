Vector addition is an operation that combines two or more vectors to produce a new vector that represents their combined effect.
The resulting vector is called the sum of the vectors.

In two-dimensional space, vector addition can be visualized as placing the tail of one vector at the head of another vector and drawing
a new vector from the tail of the first vector to the head of the second vector. 
The resulting vector represents the combined effect of the two input vectors.

For example, consider two vectors in 2D space:

v1 = (2, 3)
v2 = (-1,4)

To add these two vectors together, we place the tail of v2 at the head of v1 and draw a new vector from the tail of v1 to the head of v2:



   |
v1 |-----> 
   |     /
   |   /
   | /
   *------->
     v2
     
The resulting vector is the vector that starts at the tail of v1 and ends at the head of v2:

v1 + v2 = (2,3) + (-1,4) = (1,7)

In three-dimensional space, vector addition is similar to two-dimensional vector addition. 
We can visualize it as placing the tail of one vector at the head of another vector,
and then drawing a new vector from the tail of the first vector to the head of the second vector.
The resulting vector represents the combined effect of the two input vectors.

For example, consider two vectors in 3D space:

v1 = (1,2,3)
v2 = (-2,1,-1)

To add these two vectors together, we place the tail of v2 at the head of v1 and draw a new vector from the tail of v1 to the head of v2:

   *----------->
   |        v2
   |
v1 |
   |
   |

The resulting vector is the vector that starts at the tail of v1 and ends at the head of v2:

v1 + v2 = (1,2,3) + (-2,1,-1) = (-1,3,2)

Vector addition satisfies the commutative and associative properties. 
This means that the order in which we add the vectors does not matter, and we can group them in any way we like.


For example:
v1 + v2 + v3 = v1 + (v2 + v3) = (v1 + v2) + v3

Vector addition is an important operation in mathematics and physics, as it allows us to combine the effects 
of multiple vectors to understand the behavior of a system.

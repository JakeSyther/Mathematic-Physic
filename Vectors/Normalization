Normalizing a vector refers to the process of converting a vector into a unit vector, which has a magnitude or length of 1.
This is typically done by dividing each component of the vector by its magnitude.

A unit vector is a vector with a magnitude of 1, but the same direction as the original vector. 
Normalizing a vector is useful in many applications because it allows us to preserve the direction of the vector while removing the effects of its magnitude.

To normalize a vector, we first calculate its magnitude using the Pythagorean theorem or the Euclidean distance formula. 
Then, we divide each component of the vector by its magnitude.
This ensures that the resulting vector has a magnitude of 1 and the same direction as the original vector.

For example, let's say we have a vector v = (3,4). To normalize this vector, we first calculate its magnitude:

|v| = âˆš(3^2 + 4^2) = 5

Then, we divide each component of the vector by its magnitude:

v_normalized = (3/5, 4/5)

The resulting vector, v_normalized, has a magnitude of 1 and the same direction as the original vector v.

Normalizing vectors is important in many applications, such as computer graphics, game development, and machine learning.
In computer graphics, normalized vectors are often used to represent lighting and shading effects, while in game development,
normalized vectors can be used to calculate the direction and speed of game objects. In machine learning, 
normalized vectors can be used to reduce the impact of the magnitude of features on the output of a model.
